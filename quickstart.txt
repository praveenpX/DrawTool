### Draw Tool ###

This is a console application written in C#. You could either run the program using visual studio or you could run the
.exe file directly in the bin folder.

##Commands##

C w h 	Create Canvas: Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.

L x1 y1 x2 y2 	

Creates a Line: Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.

R x1 y1 x2 y2 	

Creates a Rectangle: Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.

B x y c 	

Bucket Fills: Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "color" c. The behavior of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.

Please take into account that you can only draw if a canvas has been created.
